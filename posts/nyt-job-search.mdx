My response to NYT's article [Computer Science Students Face a Shrinking Big Tech Job Market](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/technology/computer-students-tech-jobs-layoffs.html). No idea if my response will be published, but I'm sharing it here anyway.

**Have you recently applied for tech internships or tech jobs? What was your experience like? How many jobs or internships did you apply for? How many companies did you hear back from?**

I have applied to roughly 15 jobs in the past week, heard back from 4 of them, invited to interview at one, which was because of a personal connection between my previous manager and that company.

**For those who recently applied for tech internships or tech jobs, how did you prepare for the technical assessments, technical interviews and behavioral interviews? How much time did it take?**

I generally do not spend any time practicing LeetCode or other formulaic, quick-challenge type assessments. Rather, I spend about 10 hours per week working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp. I also spend 15 hours per week searching for and applying to jobs.

**How did you feel about the companies' responses to your applications? If companies ghosted you, how did you feel about it?**

It hurts to be ghosted, but I have been on the other side, evaluating candidates at a company where everyone was expected to review the applicant pipeline and add a few notes about each person. Sometimes people just apply for things they're woefully underqualified for, or the job listing isn't clear enough and the qualified folks never apply. It isn't easy to give constructive feedback if there's a huge misalignment like that, so it's easier to ghost.

I've certainly applied for positions that expect much more seniority than I have, and once or twice I've been pleasantly surprised by an interview, but ghosting is the default and I've made peace with it.

**Tell us about your successes with applying for tech jobs or internships.**

I have been most successful applying to places which have not placed heavy emphasis on years of experience or university education in their listings. One of my previous jobs was one where they made it clear early on that their team cares about results, not pedigrees.

Once I was able to move forward past the initial screening (almost by chance), I did a take-home assessment (which was paid), and then had a call with senior engineers, to whom I explained some of the tradeoffs I had chosen to make in that project. It was all very practical.

**What are your frustrations with the tech internship or job application process?**

My frustrations are mostly about the industry at large: there are a lot of companies whose real business is advertising, or selling software to other software companies, or some way of financializing social relations via crypto or marketplace dynamics.

Even with startups, after enough interviews it gets hard to tell these companies apart, or even feign excitement at these conservative approaches to what a business can be and do. Many of these companies also take themselves deathly seriously because they all want to be the next FAANG company, or Stripe, or Coinbase. Very few of them want to build a "bicycle for the mind."

**For those who already interned at a tech company, what did you enjoy about it? What did you learn? Did you expect and receive a return offer?**

I enjoyed the raw challenge of dealing with different environments: build pipelines, platform requirements of browsers or virtual machines, fundamental questions of how to synchronize actions over time to produce a desired output.

I learned that even the simple apps—especially the simple apps—often have a lot of complexity behind them. I did receive a return offer but I did not take it because it would have required me to relocate.

**For those who were recently laid off by a tech company or had employment offers rescinded, have you already started a new job search? How is the process going so far?**

I have submitted many applications, and I still feel uninspired by the "blah" business models of so many companies out there. I'm hoping the right opportunity presents itself. I think it is not a question of when or how I will get another job, but how to tell when a certain opportunity will be fulfilling.
