Knowledge work is kind of lame. You sit in an air-conditioned office (or apartment) for eight hours a day and then — if you're disciplined — you spend an hour in the gym, which of course you pay for.

You pay to work out, you pay to order lunch, you pay for a business-casual outfit, and when those clothes start fraying you throw them out. Your primary skills are thinking and talking. The aesthetics of this lifestyle are predictable, but incredibly boring, and I can't imagine doing this for another 40 years.

It seems antisocial or somehow ungrateful to make a statement like that. Why?

This lifestyle was one I idolized as a kid, and now I've lived it. I grew up in the Bay Area, which, thanks to technology, is a uniquely wealthy environment, but as innovative as some people there may be, their idea of a good life isn't that all that unique or contrarian.

It's understandable why so many people want healthcare, 401k matching, a nice little nest egg which grows alongside your promotion every couple of years. Everyone needs a sense of safety, and a stable job seems like a shortcut to keeping that baseline level of safety.

I made a pledge to stay as far away from the 9-5, beige-cubicle aesthetics as I could get. I felt that the typical tech job would probably also have these aesthetics. Google and Apple employees were the lucky few who _didn't_ have shitty offices. If I'd had stayed in the Bay, it seemed much more likely that I'd end up at Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, or VMware doing nothing all that exciting.

I received all the support in the world to "do what I love" and so I set course for the East Coast to find that.

Once I got to college in New York, I interned at a couple of advertising agencies. Packed with young people, they were irreverent workplaces, with plants and seltzer water and posters with curse-words in the office. This felt like a step in the right direction because the aesthetics of work were so much better than what I had imagined.

You have to remember I wasn't even in the workforce yet when _The Office_ aired, but it had a great effect on me. I watched that show like everyone else and found it hilarious — I imagined one day I'd go back and watch it as an adult, laughing for a different reason and thinking, ah yes, this is what my life is like now.

I was disappointed to discover that the ambitions of people around me in the advertising industry weren't as exciting as the work they made. Many folks either had this inflated self-image where they were [Don Draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Draper), helmsman of an old noble industry, and they could steer the ship with "strategy" while doing virtually no work themselves — or they were some sort of [Nolita Dirtbag](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl9cptQOOwh/) caricature, down in the trenches as a photographer but basically just doing this job to fund new sneakers to wear at the skate park. For those guys it was totally fine to show up to work high off a dab pen because they were _so creative_. The ambition either took itself too seriously or wasn't there at all.

At that point, in 2018 or so, I began waking up to how software companies made money. Much of this coincides with the first few rounds of Congressional hearings about [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) and the moral panic around how deep the [FAANGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#FAANG) had sunk into our lives.

Rather than buy into a lot of fear-mongering from the old guard, I thought, hmm, making money off data itself is quite interesting. Tech companies at the time seemed to be printing money while following none of the rules of profit, loss, income and expenses I had learned in accounting class. There had to be something there.

And so I joined several software startups and even founded my own. I'll talk in broad strokes to avoid ruffling anyone's feathers. Basically the vibe in [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) is that your company's product doesn't have to do all that much by itself, it just needs to connect with the right external services, and either reformat information or present it in a more visually attractive way. That's it. If you get introductions to several famous companies and can then use their logos on your website, even better.

By no means is it ever _easy_ to raise venture money, but it wasn't particularly hard from 2018–21. If you found the right "founder-friendly" investor, after you raised capital you could just scale out your sales and marketing organization to add an air of legitimacy to the business.

It didn't matter how little money was coming in from sales, so long as you could find investors who believed your graphs might suddenly go vertical, at which point a small stake in your multi-billion dollar business would allow them to retire.

_<small>I never did work at a company which went through the SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) process, but that was an even more insane phenomenon during this time. Investors were looking for anything and everything which might have a venture-scale outcome. The organizers of a SPAC sell shares on the public market for an empty holding company which exists solely to buy out another business, thereby bringing that business to the public market. Once enough shares are sold, the interest is there and the transaction proceeds.</small>_

_<small>SPACs create a really bad incentive for the organizer: they can grease the metrics a little bit on some startup which has revenue but is not profitable, and then convince the voting shareholders to go forward. Sort of like a scratch-off ticket, everyone else who owns shares in the SPAC but didn't or couldn't vote on the acquisition will only find out what they've bought after the transaction has gone through.</small>_

_<small>Pardon the disgusting analogy, but buying into a SPAC is like screwing someone with a bag over their head. It satisfies the basic dopamine rush of "investing", but the act itself is not about the merit of the investment. Organizers of SPACs thought they were geniuses because they found out how to pimp out marginal businesses instead of building and supporting them directly.</small>_

I tried to keep exploring the consumer social media space, but just like with SPACs, it seemed the only way to keep the lights on was to put on this charade that we could someday be Facebook, Snapchat, Spotify, or TikTok. What we actually offered and what we wanted to do day-to-day was secondary to making ourselves _look_ like a venture-scale business and getting buy-in.

Reader, I'm not sure I have given you a convincing send-up of knowledge work writ large. There are tons of scientists, researchers, heck, even financiers who do meaningful and important work. But I really do believe they are the exceptions.

In American society, in this day and age, it's just all too simple for one of us to take the easy route and expect the good life, and instead find the ugly underbelly of greed and emptiness.
