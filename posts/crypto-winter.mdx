Without question, cryptocurrency and Web3 have occupied a lion’s share of the online discourse of the tech-adjacent chattering class. Indeed, many of the media moguls of so-called Web2 have also tried to get in on the action, including Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports and his entry into “shitcoins” with Safemoon, which was anything but safe. Jimmy Fallon got wrapped up in NFT speculation, many more have lost big on “algorithmic stablecoins.” Clear signs of the top.


One of the hardest challenges within cryptocurrency is the user experience, a sentiment shared by many people who work within that space. In the past few years, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Square (to name a few) have successfully lowered the barrier to entry for the unsophisticated buyer. However, because of this consolidation into a few centralized exchanges, an identity crisis has started to play out between people who believe that getting more people into crypto is an unequivocally good thing (even if that means compromising on decentralization), and others who believe that the future lies in non-custodial wallets.


These questions of architecture and ideals will always be interesting to a certain kind of nerd. I say this lovingly; I am one of those nerds, and I’ve watched from the sidelines with fascination, dipping my toes into this treacherous market with a few hundred USD here and there, netting basically flat returns. But the vast majority of people cannot and will not put in the effort to understand the tradeoffs and cost structures of different coins, marketplaces, and digital assets. Instead, motivated by fear of recession, fear of missing out, or just boredom and a stimulus check, they’ll be drawn in to someone or another’s too-good-to-be-true promises and get burned. That’s part of the game with any new, risky asset class, and I kind of understand the disdain with which some crypto veterans look at newcomers who are playing a game they don’t understand.


What I ask of crypto is to remember its place in the economic stack. Blockchain-based protocols indeed have a good chance of replacing legacy technologies like ACH and wire transfers. But crypto “investing” is not the Web3 economy any more than the stock market is the Web2 economy. Crypto can be an exciting arena for the distribution of capital, but it is not the source of productive capacity, just as ACH itself is not the source of a wage-earner’s paycheck. It is the socially useful task a worker performs that generates capital; ACH is a “dumb pipe” through which capital flows.


Novel technologies of transferring value indeed have a way of creating markets around their use, just as ACH enables payday loans, credit cards enable debt collection agencies, and home equity enables collateralized debt obligations. But the average investor cannot and should not get involved with these arcane contracts which are so far removed from the economy of physical and social goods. Unlike in Web3, in the landscape of Web2, users of its protocols don’t need to buy and sell stock in Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal just to reap the benefits of participation in those networks. Users can buy and sell stocks in those companies if they wish, but that’s clearly a different type of transaction than sending money through their pipes, and carries a totally different level of risk.


DAOs, especially DAOs where the mission is to make more money for the DAO, are similarly idiotic in that token-holding members are expected to have an opinion as to how the network operates at the technical level. It is akin to asking all the passengers on a commercial airliner to have an opinion on how the landing gear struts should attach to the wings, or how many foot-pounds of thrust will be needed to generate the excess lift needed to climb. Frankly, it is okay that there is a team of aeronautical engineers who made these decisions, and a team of pilots who use this information is to effectively guide the aircraft.


The operation of a 545,000-pound flying machine doesn’t need to be egalitarian; it is okay that it’s in the hands of a few experts, especially when these experts are legally bound to be accountable for their decisions. A Boeing 777 is an exceedingly complex piece of technology, but for the passenger, it is still a “dumb pipe” to get from point A to point B.


Accordingly, blaming an unsophisticated retail investor for losing money in protocols they don’t understand is much like blaming a passenger for a plane crash because they didn’t personally inspect the plane for airworthiness. It is a cowardly response that demonstrates the lack of professionalism and accountability among builders in the crypto space. It is made worse by complex language and deliberate use of phrases like “stable,” “risk-free,” and “projected APY” designed to mislead — words like these convey obligations which have not been met.


To builders in crypto, I ask that you read the [Obligation of the Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_Ring#The_Obligation_of_The_Engineer). Ask yourself if you’ve been humble, if you’ve dealt fairly, if you’ve “serve[d] humanity by making best use of the Earth’s precious wealth.”
