I started this series of projects when I had just begun my journey as a student pilot. To familiarize myself with aircraft systems and running checklists, I wanted to build a realistic simulator on a budget.

Graphics and such are far less important to me than realistic interfaces. Here's what my setup looked like (with X-Plane and Logitech/Saitek controls).

# The switch panel

I built a switch panel which would issue commands to X-Plane by sending keystrokes. I flashed the Arduino Micro board to appear as a generic keyboard, and the `turn on / off` commands for each aircraft system would correspond to a unique key character.

**The final result looks like this:**

I sketched and then 3D-printed a case for the Micro in PLA.

Wiring it all up.

Interrupts were used to detect rising/falling events on the digital input pins. The downside of sending events from the device as keystrokes is that there is no two-way synchronization of state between the real switch and the virtual, so at startup, you'd have to set your virtual switches once to match the state of the real switches.

# The COM/NAV controller

Having built up my confidence somewhat in CAD, I took on a more ambitious project to create a COM/NAV radio controller.

I had learned my lesson about the pitfalls of treating the interface device as a keyboard; and this device would surely need two-way communication to display the active/standby frequencies on the LCD display.

[Code for the controller on GitHub](https://github.com/samwinslow/arduino-hid-examples/blob/main/flightsim/teensy_freq.cpp) (C++).

The component I'm most proud of: a unit for driving two separate rotary encoders from concentric knobs.

Here are all the major internals: the rotary encoder assembly, the Arduino, the 16x2 LCD, and a momentary switch to flip the active/standby frequencies.

I based the dimensions on a real Bendix-King radio panel and designed a special housing for the momentary switch button.

# The standalone IoT METAR display

Just for fun, I wanted to build a small unit which would poll the publicly available METAR data for a local airport and display it on a compact screen. Here are the internals, featuring a Raspberry Pi and relays left over from another automation project. The idea was to trigger certain real-world devices based on the weather forecast and time of day.

**As before, here's the final result:**

The display is the guts of a Dell monitor driven by a separate Lenovo SFF PC.

Custom printed brackets hold the PC in place from top and bottom with the help of gravity.
